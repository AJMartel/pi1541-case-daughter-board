Makes it a little easier to wire and install the buttons/leds.

This is a daughter board to be used in the case found here:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3127040

However, my thingiverse copy is a WIP and will be uploaded once I get these boards back and ensure everything fits.

This uses standard 6x6mm push button switches and 1x4 and 1x8 2.54mm pitch headers.
